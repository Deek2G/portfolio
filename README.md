## Projects
### Real Estate Property Listing Project with Laravel, MySQL, and Bootstrap

 I designed and developed a complete web platform using Laravel, MySQL, and Bootstrap. The project aimed to create a user-friendly system where property owners could list their properties, and buyers or renters could easily search and filter listings based on various criteria like location, price, and property type. I utilized Laravel's powerful framework to build a secure backend, MySQL for managing the database of properties and users, and Bootstrap to design a responsive and intuitive interface. The platform also included features like user authentication, a system for saving properties, and an admin dashboard for managing listings and user accounts. This project enhanced the real estate browsing experience by making it easy to list, search, and manage properties online.
