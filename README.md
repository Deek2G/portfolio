## Projects

### PetroLog: Fuel Tracking App using Flutter, Dart, & Firebase

I built PetroLog as a cross-platform mobile app using Flutter and Dart, designed to help users track their fuel consumption, mileage, and vehicle-related expenses. To ensure real-time data synchronization and secure cloud storage, I integrated Firebase services, including Firestore for database management and Firebase Authentication for user login and account security. The app features a clean, user-friendly interface, detailed fuel log entries, expense summaries, and visual insights to help users understand their driving habits and costs. Itâ€™s built to be scalable, reliable, and accessible from any device.

### HealthyLife: Clinic Appointment Management System using Django Framework (Python)

HealthyLife is a web-based clinic management system I built using the Django framework in Python. The system streamlines the appointment booking process for both patients and healthcare providers. It includes features such as user authentication, role-based access control, appointment scheduling, patient record management, and automated email notifications. I designed this system to improve clinic workflow efficiency, reduce manual errors, and provide a better experience for both patients and staff.
